              <p> My favorite Class in Stevens so far has been CS-546 coz I dont need to go to actually go to class for it lol. Please give me those Grades professor. I know I kinda messed up last assignments, I'm really struggling with them. HELLP</p>
              <aside>In Stevens , I don't really have any good memories yet. So lets make this one up. LEt's say I was studying in Library and then headed out for a smoke, a girl joined me by asking for my lighter. And then we happily lived together ever after. See smoking is not all that bad after all</aside>

              <p>Oh iloved  my Theory of Computation class by Raviraj Sir. That guy was a legend. He though so nicely, and also as we had mandatory 75% attendance policy, that guy was good with me, he would mark me as present</p>
